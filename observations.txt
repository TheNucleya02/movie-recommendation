OBSERVATIONS BASAED ON THE DATA ANALYSIS

1. TRY TO WORK WITH ONE DATASET WHEN THERE ARE MORE THAN ONE.
2. THE WHOLE IDEA IS TO MINIMIZE THE FEATURES AS THERE ARE 23 FEATURES AFTER MERGING.
    THE MODEL WILL ONLY GET CONFUSED.
3. FIRSTLY TRY TO SELECT ONLY MEANINGFULL FEATURES OR CREATE ONE.
4. HERE WE CREATED YEAR COLUMN BECAUSE IT HIGHLY AFFECTS THE RECOMMENDATION.
5. DO THE DATA CLEANING, PREPROCESSING.
6. TO MOVE AHEAD WITH THE TEXT PROCESSING, WE FIRST CONVERTED THE ENTRIES IN COLUMNS INTO LIST.
7. LIKE THE DIRECTOR NAME IS MOST IMPORTANT AMONG THE CAST SO WE SELECT IT ONLY.
8. THEN WE DID LOWERING AND REMOVING THE SPACE FROM THE TEXT COLUMNS.
9. AFTER THAT WE MERGET THE TEXT COLUMNS[CAST CREW GENRE KEYWORDS AND OVERVIEW] INTO ONE CALLED TAGS
10. AS I SAID THE IDEA IS TO MINIMIZE THE FEATURE WHILE PRESERVING THE ESSENCE.
11. ONE IMPORTANT THING THAT I NOTICED IS THAT AFTER DOING ALL THE PREPROCESSING WE CREATE A NEW_DF TO TRAIN THE MODEL.
12. WE DO NOT PASS A COLUMN OF LIST TO THE MODEL. THE LIST WAS JUST CREATED TO DO THE PREPROCESSING.
13. THUS WE CONVERTED TAGS COLUMN AS STRING ENTRIES.
14. WE DO STEMMING USING PORTER STEMMER
15. WE USE COUNT VECTORIZER TO FORM VECTORS
16. WE FIND THE SIMILARITY AND DUMPED THE MODEL INTO PKL FILES.
